  # Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
This project focuses on building a predictive model to determine the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using the Kaggle dataset. The process includes:

Data Exploration: Analyzing the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships between features.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features to improve model performance.
Model Building: Implementing machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.
Model Evaluation: Using cross-validation and accuracy scores to assess model performance.
The project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline and achieves an accuracy of approximately [add your model's accuracy here]. It highlights the importance of feature engineering and model selection in predictive modeling.
